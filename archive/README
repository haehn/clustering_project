Files for running a simulation with ALF, generating 25 genes,
10 belonging to class1 - simulated along one random tree
15 belonging to class2 - simulated along another random tree

Required files: 
ALF_wrapper.py - functions to write ALF parameters and run simulation
handleArgs.py - function to get command line arguments into program
sequence_record.py - class and init function for handling sequences

Script files:
runsim.py - generates alignments and true trees using ALF
runraxml - generates tree inferences for each gene using raxml, 
           with -l cluster or -l local determining where the
           raxml executable will run (cluster job does 10 reps to
           improve tree)

Currently workflow is run runsim.py, then run runraxml.py. These could
be wrapped by another script, to give finer control over parameters which
are currently hard-coded
