This experiment used 100 simulated datasets generated by 
runsim.py -c 24 -g 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This creates 4 topology classes with 5 genes each, and 20 singular topologies. A good distance metric and clustering linkage will pick up on the structure in the data - the 4 classes.

I ran two experiments - one looking for 4 classes and one looking for 5. Each tested the combinations of euc, rf, sym and geo distances* and complete linkage, single linkage and Ward's method of clustering. I ran 100 instances of each. The results are the Variation of Information metric comparing the discovered partition with the true partition, and the final sum of squares summed over all cluster trees.


* These are: euc = euclidean distances, or Felsenstein's Branch Length Score, rf = weighted Robinson-Foulds, sym = symmetric difference, or standard Robinson-Foulds, and Billera et al's Geodesic distance
