Alignment has 304 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 18.98%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 10 inferences on the original alignment using 10 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 304
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: AA
Substitution Matrix: WAG
